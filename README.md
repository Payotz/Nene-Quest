==================

*Game on the left, Anime episode on the right.*

## What is this?
This is my attempt at recreating "Nene Quest", a video game made by the anime character "Sakura Nene". I wrote this to learn more about OpenGL, SDL and C++.

This video game can be seen in New Game S2 - Episode 6.

This is the refactor branch. I'm currently refactoring it to be less messy and to work properly.

Original work can be seen at branch `master`
